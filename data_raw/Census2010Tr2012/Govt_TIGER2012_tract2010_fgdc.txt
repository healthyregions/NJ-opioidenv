  Description:
    Abstract:
      Census Tract boundary polygons (2010 Census) for the State of New Jersey, as of 2012.

      For additional documentation, see the US Census Bureau, TIGER data Web site.
    Purpose: Data reprojected by NJOIT OGIS for use in state Web maps and for redistribution to GIS desktop users.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Shapefile in geographic coordinates was downloaded from the US Census Bureau Web site for New Jersey Partnership Shapefile Batch Download on January 7, 2013:  

            http://www.census.gov/geo/partnerships/pvs/bas/st34_nj.html

            The data were developed in partnership with the NJ State Redistricting Commission, following the 2010 U.S. Census.

            The shapefile was then reprojected to NAD83 NJ State Plane coordinates, US Survey feet, and several empty attributes were deleted.
