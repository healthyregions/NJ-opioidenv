Information about finalized data

Physical Environment 2015
- Data only for 2015
- All data originally from nj_land_use_state_county_municipality_1986_2015
- This is from Rowan University Geodata

- pct_high_density_res: proportion of what the data lists as "high density or multiple dwelling" area divided by total residential area
- pct_not_high_density_res 1- pct_high_density_res
- pct_residential_of_urban: total residential area divided by total Urban area 
- pct_commercial_of_urban: total commercial area divided by total Urban area 
- pct_industrial_of_urban: total Industrial AND Industrial and Commercial Complexes areas divided by total Urban area 
- pct_residential_of_total: total residential area divided by total area of municipality
- pct_commercial_of_total:  total commercial area divided by total area of municipality
- pct_industrial_of_total:  total industrial AND Industrial and Commercial Complexes areas divided by total area of municipality


Methodological Decisions cleaning these data:
- Did not look at data for other than 2015; 
- Arbitrarily decided to try to measure "Residential structure density" by proportion of high density residences
- Arbitrarily decided to include "Industrial and Commercial Complexes" to Industrial not Commercial
- Treated NA as 0 area of a given type in a given municipality

Other Notes:
- There were three different levels of specificity
- "Urban" was the highest level, measuring urban vs different types of nature
- Residential/commercial/industrial/industrial and commercial are the middle level of specificity
- The different types of residential buildings were at the smallest level of specificity. 
- I divided some by larger scales where the smaller ones may not have perfectly added to the larger ones (probably due to the fact that there was some small groups like mixed use that counted in different categories). This could be a thing to return to methodologically, but I am not too worried. -GDM
