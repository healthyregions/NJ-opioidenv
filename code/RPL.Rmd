# Calculating Segregation
First we need to load some libraries. We use R to get all of our census data from the American Community Survey.

Below, we will use counties in New Jersey and use the 2018 ACS B03002 table. This table gives population estimates by race and Hispanic ethnicity.


```{r NJ, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## Getting data from CDC SVI website (2018, New Jersey)
# check for available variables in the census data (in this case American Community Survey)
path <- ("/Users/xiafm/Documents/GitHub/NJ-opioidenv/data_raw/SVI/")
svi <- read_csv(paste0(path, "NewJersey.csv"))
head(svi)
```
